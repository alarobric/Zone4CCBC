# Timing

## Pre-race setup

Zone4 allows you to do quite a lot while the race is in progress, but it's still best to be prepared and get some things setup beforehand.

TODO

- Configure course groups
- Configure result sets (overall, category, chip handout lists, etc)
- Configure and test timing points

## During the race

TODO

- Timing grids
- Results
- Announcer view

- Sample bib order sheet, old Zone4 interface uploaded as assets
