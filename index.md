# Zone4 with CCBC

The web version of Zone4 and accompanying Go Chips system is a large change from what many are used to using to time cross-country skiing and other sports in British Columbia.
This site will help give some best practices and pointers for how to use the software in a well-known consistent manner throughout the province.

Please note that Zone4 is always changing and improving their software, and content here may become out of date. They have a great help system of their own over at [Zone4 Help](http://help.zone4.ca/).

## Registration

The first step to running a race is getting people registered.

- Create a registration page
- Create a race
- Setup start groups
- Create the start list and post it online

## Pre-race setup

Zone4 allows you to do quite a lot while the race is in progress, but it's still best to be prepared and get some things setup beforehand.

- Configure course groups
- Configure result sets (overall, category, chip handout lists, etc)
- Configure and test timing points

## During the race

- Timing grids
- Results

## Other resources

- As mentioned before, try the Zone4 official help pages first: [Zone4 Help](http://help.zone4.ca/).
- Contact an experienced volunteer: @alarobric on Github, Twitter, Facebook, etc. has done timing for many races at Whistler and Kamloops, and can also put you in contact with others in the province.
