# Overview

The web version of Zone4 and accompanying Go Chips system is a large change from what many are used to using to time cross-country skiing and other sports in British Columbia.
This site will help give some best practices and pointers for how to use the software in a well-known consistent manner throughout the province.

Please note that Zone4 is always changing and improving their software, and content here may become out of date. They have a great help system of their own over at [Zone4 Help](http://help.zone4.ca/).

## [Registration](registration)

The first step to running a race is getting people registered.

TODO

- Create a registration page
- Create a race
- Setup start groups
- Create the start list and post it online

## Pre-race setup

Zone4 allows you to do quite a lot while the race is in progress, but it's still best to be prepared and get some things setup beforehand.

TODO

- Configure course groups
- Configure result sets (overall, category, chip handout lists, etc)
- Configure and test timing points

## [Hardware](hardware)

Including information on different hardware requirements for different types and size of races, as well as the new GoChips, activators, and phones.

## [Day of - setup](setup)

Includes discussion on network setup and configuration, the physical setup of the timing equipment, and chip distribution.

## More TODO

- Chip tester tool
- Server box
- How do Summits fit in?

## [During the race](timing)

TODO

- Timing grids
- Results
- Announcer view

- Sample bib order sheet, old Zone4 interface uploaded as assets

## Document resources

### Run sheet

[Run sheet](run-sheet) - describes tasks done by different teams throughout the race
